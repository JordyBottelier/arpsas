Catches are stratified by year, species, fishing gear, vessel flag reporting country. It corresponds to the catch part of the WCPFC nominal catch (task1) dataset.\n\nThis dataset was downloaded on the WCPFC website. It was then restructured to be in line with the Sardara database structure (columns normalization, names, etc.). However the content of data and the code lists were kept exactly as their are available in the source dataset.\n\nThe description below (caracteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account) is extracted from the WCPFC web page where the dataset has been downloaded.\n\nCaracteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into accountÂ\xa0:\n\nThe tables of catch statistics cover the main commercial tuna and billfish species caught in the region: albacore (Thunnus alalunga), bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), black marlin (Makaira indica), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The WCFPC, through their member countries, are now obliged to compile estimates of key shark species, some of which are now covered in the longline fleet tables: blue shark (Prionace glauca), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and mako sharks (Isurus spp.). Catches of other species are not covered explicitly, and discards are not considered.\n\nThe main industrial fishing methods employed in the WCPFC region include longline, pole-and-line, purse seine and troll. The domestic fisheries of Indonesia and the Philippines employ several other methods. Driftnet fishing for albacore in the South Pacific Ocean ceased in 1991. Individual fleets presented herein cover vessels that are flagged to that nation and those vessels considered to be 'chartered' according to the WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure (CMM-2012-05) on Charter Notification.\n\nFor the purse-seine fishery, recent studies using observer data (e.g. Lawson, 2007, Lawson, 2010, Lawson, 2012, Lawson, 2013, Lawson, 2014, Hampton and Williams, 2011, Hampton and Williams, 2015) show that the logsheet-reported catch, mainly for associated sets, should contain higher quantities of yellowfin and bigeye tuna that have been misreported as skipjack tuna. Purse-seine catch estimates that have been adjusted with species compositions determined from observer grab samples corrected for size selectivity bias (see Lawson, 2010, Lawson, 2012, Lawson, 2013, and Lawson, 2014) are presented herein as the best available WCFPC purse-seine catch estimates for skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna. All composite tables and figures referring to purse-seine species catch are consistent with these estimates. The estimates of purse seine catch by species may differ from the original estimates provided by WCPFC member countries for their fleets, but total purse seine catch will not differ. The purse seine species catch estimates are produced from statistical models and will therefore change from year to year as more data become available.\n\nFor the longline fishery, estimates of key shark species have improved in recent years but for most fleets remain uncertain due to (i) clear under-reporting of catches, or (ii) very low coverage of observer data used to estimate these catches.\n\nThe tables of annual catch estimates for individual fleets cover those years during which the fleet is known to have fished; the lack of recent years in a table implies that the fleet has ceased fishing.\n\nThe sources of the estimates are available from the SPC Oceanic Fisheries Programme.", 'This adamussium colbecki Species Distribution Map for 2050 has been generated with the AquaMaps methodology by exploiting the technology and the computational resources provided by iMarine.

Catches are stratified by year and fishing gear. It corresponds to the CCSBT nominal catch (task1) dataset.\n\n\nThis dataset was downloaded on the CCSBT website. It was then restructured to be in line with the Sardara database structure (columns normalization, names, etc.). However the content of data and the code lists were kept exactly as their are available in the source dataset.\n\nThe description below (caracteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account) is extracted from the CCSBT web page where the dataset has been downloaded.\n\n\nCaracteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into accountÂ\xa0:\n\nEstimates of the global SBT catch will be updated on an annual basis within two months of the CCSBT annual meeting in October of each year. Note: reviews of SBT data in 2006 indicated that southern bluefin tuna catches may have been substantially under-reported over the previous 10-20 years and the data presented here do not yet include estimates for this unreported catch.\n\nIt should be noted that the data for individual Flag States and fishing entities shown here may differ to data that those Flag States and fishing entities have provided separately to other organisations. This is in part due to the data manipulations conducted by the CCSBT in producing this dataset (a variety of data sources were used, requiring a range of correction and raising techniques) and in part due to differences in the data provided by individual Flag States and fishing entities to the CCSBT and to other organisations. In particular, the post 1994 SBT data provided by Japan to the CCSBT differs from the post 1994 SBT data that Japan provides to other regional fishery management organisations. The data that Japan provides to CCSBT takes advantage of a Real Time Monitoring Program for SBT to collect daily catch and effort reports from SBT targeting fishing vessels and this is considered to minimise the time lag in availability of the Japanese SBT log book data.', 'This Ambassis productus Species Distribution Map has been generated with the AquaMaps methodology by exploiting the technology and the computational resources provided by iMarine.
